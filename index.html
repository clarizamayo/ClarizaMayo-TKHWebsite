     <h5>Who am I?</h5>
     <p> Hello! My name is Clariza Mayo. I am a very happy person and love to live life to the fullest! I love learning new things and enjoy overcoming challenges.</p>
     <p> My parents moved to the United States when I was two years old. I always believed that United States would be the turning point in my life. After 10 years, I was able to reunite with my mother when I came to this country. I was twelve years old at that time. Since then, I have been trying to work for a better future for my family and me. I would like to suceed while doing something I love because at the end of the day; money isn't everything.</p>
     <h5>Below you will find pictures of me at some of my happiest times. Because I think that a picture can say 1,000 words.</h5>

     <p> In my third picture, my family and I decided to take a trip to the beach. The planning took us months since is hard for everyone to get the same day off. This was the first trip we shared after many years and as you can see I had a lot of fun running through the waves </p>
