	<h1>Welcome to my First Website!</h1>
	<h3>
    In this website, you will learn the reasons why I want to become a TKH Fellow and be accepted into the Data Science
		track.

	<h3 class="whoami"> Who am I?	</h3>
	<p> 
    Hello! My name is Clariza Mayo. I am a very happy person and love to live life to the fullest! I love learning new things
		and enjoy overcoming challenges.
  </p>
	<p> 
    My parents moved to the United States when I was two years old. I always believed that United States would be the turning point in my life. 
  <br>
    After 10 years, when I was 12, I was able to reunite with my mother when I came to this country. Since then, I have been working on creating a better future for my family and myself. 
  <br>
    I would like to suceed while doing something I love because at the end of the day, money isn't everything.
  </p>
	<p>
    Because I think that a picture can say 1,000 words. Below you will find some of my happiest times.

    <p class="textimage"> In this picture, I had just moved to a new place on my own.
      <br> 
  It was not a huge place, but I achieved it on my own and it felt very refreshing to see the fruits of my labor.</p>

    <p class="textimage"> This was during my first trip to upstate Ithaca, NY.
    <br>  
     I went for a walk with friends, and our surroundings were all green and peaceful.
    <br>
     I went out to explore and found this carved gorge called <em>Buttermilk Gorge</em>.</p>

    <p class="textimage"> 
      My family and I decided to take a trip to the beach.
    <br>
     The planning took us months since is hard for everyone to get the same day off. 
    <br>
     This was our first trip after many years, and I had a lot of fun running through the waves!
